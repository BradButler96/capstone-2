**API:** 
https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com

**API Notes:** 
The API has a good amount of information for being free, however it does have a few bugs that altered the steps for retreiving and presenting the information. It often returns token duplicates which makes it difficult to create a list for users to browse. It also does not offer current news and price charts on the free version, but this was not unique to Coin Marketcap, I was unable to find any free APIs that offer these features which is why there is no news page and the charts when browsing token details are just a black rectangle.

**App Description:** 
This site will allow users to browse cryptocurrencies and get up to date market data. Users will be able to browse tokens by market cap and filter by various other properties. They will also be able to browse various categories, as well as, the tokens that fall into those categories. On their profile a user will be able to view tokens they have favorited as well as enter buy and sell orders, which will track their overall P&L.

The application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, React and Postgres.
